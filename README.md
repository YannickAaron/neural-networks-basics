# Neural Network basics

# prequisites
This repository uses poetry to manage the dependencies and creates a virtual environment.
Make sure you have poetry installed.

Addtionally pyenv can be used. 

Python-version: 3.10.3

run `sh install.sh` to create a virtual environment and install all dependencies.

## overview

### Neural Network from scratch
This folders contains a notebook where i implemendet a neural network from scratch.
I didn't used any libarys such as pytorch or keras to do so.
In the end, i created a simple two layer neural network to regognize handwritten digits from the famous MNIST dataset.
